/**
 * Added in version 6.8.0
 *
 * The spark capture session is responsible for determining the list of relevant barcodes by filtering out duplicates. This filtering of duplicates is completely time-based and does not use any information about the location of the barcode. By default, all the codes scanned in a frame are always reported. It is possible to filter out codes recently scanned by changing SDCSparkCaptureSettings.codeDuplicateFilter.
 *
 * When the spark capture mode is disabled, the sessionâ€™s duplicate filter is reset.
 *
 * The spark capture session should only be accessed from within sparkCapture:didScanInSession:frameData: or sparkCapture:didUpdateSession:frameData: and from the thread these methods are called from. It is not safe to be accessed from anywhere else since it may be concurrently modified.
 *
 * Specifically no reference to newlyRecognizedBarcodes should be kept and traversed outside of sparkCapture:didScanInSession:frameData: or sparkCapture:didUpdateSession:frameData:. Instead a copy of the lists should be made to avoid concurrent modification. The individual barcodes can be referenced without copying as they are not further modified.
