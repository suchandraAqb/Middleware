/**
 * Added in version 6.0.0
 *
 * The capture session is responsible for determining the list of relevant barcodes by filtering out duplicates. This filtering of duplicates is completely time-based and doesn’t use any information about the location of the barcode. By default, all the codes scanned in a frame are always reported. It is possible to filter out codes recently scanned by changing SDCBarcodeCaptureSettings.codeDuplicateFilter.
 *
 * For location-based tracking over multiple frames, you may be better off using SDCBarcodeTracking.
 *
 * When the barcode capture mode is disabled, the session’s duplicate filter is reset.
 *
 * The capture session should only be accessed from within barcodeCapture:didScanInSession:frameData: or barcodeCapture:didUpdateSession:frameData: to which it is provided as an argument. It is not safe to be accessed from anywhere else since it may be concurrently modified.
 *
 * Specifically no reference to newlyRecognizedBarcodes or newlyLocalizedBarcodes should be kept and traversed outside of barcodeCapture:didScanInSession:frameData: or barcodeCapture:didUpdateSession:frameData:. Instead a copy of the lists should be made to avoid concurrent modification. The individual barcodes can be referenced without copying as they are not further modified.
