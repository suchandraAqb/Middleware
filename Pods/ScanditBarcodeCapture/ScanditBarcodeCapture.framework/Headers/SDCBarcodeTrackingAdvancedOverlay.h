/**
 * Added in version 6.0.0
 *
 * An overlay for SDCDataCaptureView that allows anchoring a single user-provided View to each tracked barcode.
 *
 * The provided view is visible on the top of the camera preview as long as its tracked barcode is and for all this time retains its relative position to it. This is useful when an additional information should be provided to tracked barcodes in real time. For instance, a user may overlay the price of an item or its expiry date for each corresponding barcode.
 *
 * To display the views, this overlay must be attached to a SDCDataCaptureView. This may be done either by creating it with overlayWithBarcodeTracking:forDataCaptureView: with a non-null view parameter or by passing this overlay to SDCDataCaptureView.addOverlay:.
 *
 * A user of this class may configure what view is displayed for the given barcode and the relative position between the two by implementing SDCBarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlayDelegate or by calling setView:forTrackedBarcode:, setAnchor:forTrackedBarcode: or setOffset:forTrackedBarcode:.
 *
 * For additional information about using this overlay, refer to Get Started With MatrixScan and Add AR Overlays in MatrixScan.
