/**
 * Added in version 6.0.0
 *
 * Protocol for location selection. Location selections implement a specific strategy how a data object (like a barcode or text) is selected out of multiple visible ones by for example only selecting objects inside a certain area or objects that intersect a certain area. See Scan Area Guide for an in-depth explanation of location selection. Implementations are provided by SDCRadiusLocationSelection and SDCRectangularLocationSelection.
 *
 * Location selection implementations are restricted to the set of location selections provided by the Scandit Data Capture SDK, it is not possible to conform to this protocol with a custom implementations of location selection. This protocol does not expose any methods or properties, it just serves as a unifying type for different selection strategies.
