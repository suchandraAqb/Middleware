/**
 * Added in version 6.0.0
 *
 * The capture view is the main UI view to be used together with the data capture context for applications that wish to display a video preview together with additional augmentations such as barcode locations.
 *
 * The data capture view itself only displays the preview and shows UI elements to control the camera, such as buttons to switch torch on and off, or a button to switch between front and back facing cameras. Augmentations, such as the locations of identified barcodes are provided by individual overlays. This view will also display errors in case something goes wrong with its context, see the SDCContextStatus for a list of possible errors.
 *
 * Unless otherwise specified, methods and properties of this class should only be accessed from the main thread.
 *
 * @remark Targeting iOS 10 and earlier
 *
 * On devices running iOS 10 and earlier, the data capture view should be constrained to be under the top layout guide and above the bottom layout guide to avoid certain parts of the view not being shown properly.
 *
 * On devices running iOS 11 and later, constraining to be inside the safe area is not necessary for the view to be shown properly and will automatically respect safe area guides.
