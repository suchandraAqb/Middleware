/**
 * Added in version 6.1.0
 *
 * A deserializer to construct frame sources from JSON. For most use cases it is enough to use SDCCamera.cameraFromJSONString:error: which internally uses this deserializer. Using the deserializer gives the advantage of being able to listen to the deserialization events as they happen and potentially influence them. Additonally warnings can be read from the deserializer that would otherwise not be available.
