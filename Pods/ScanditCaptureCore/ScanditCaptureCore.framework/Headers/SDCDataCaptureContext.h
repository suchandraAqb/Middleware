/**
 * Added in version 6.0.0
 *
 * Data capture context is the main class for running data-capture related tasks. The context manages one or more capture modes, such as SDCBarcodeCapture that perform the recognition. The context itself acts as a scheduler, but does not provide any interfaces for configuring data capture capabilities. Configuration and result handling is handled by the data capture modes directly.
 *
 * Each data capture context has exactly one frame source (typically a built-in camera). The frame source delivers the frames on which the capture modes should perform recognition on. When a new capture context is created, it’s frame source is nil and must be initialized for recognition to work.
 *
 * Typically a SDCDataCaptureView is used to visualize the ongoing data capture process on screen together with one or more overlays. However it’s also possible to use the data capture context without a view to perform off-screen processing.
 *
